# Prework Study Guide Project Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide contains some notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I built the project because it was a good introductory assignment to help familiarize me with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as the process for committing file updates to GitHub Repository for this project. In some sense, this project solves the need for a quick-access sheet of notes and shortcut information about working with front end coding in tandem with GitHub and the development process.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
